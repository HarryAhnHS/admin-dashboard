# admin-dashboard

# RepMe is a workout and exercise regimen social platform to share techniques, workout splits, and progress. 

This project contains mostly the front-end design of the dashboard page. Implemented a dummy back-end structure with randomized and hard-coded user content. Currently lacking real functionality - saving this for later project down the Odin road with more intel.
